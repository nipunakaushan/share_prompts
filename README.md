This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Rendering - Its all begins with the rendering process

what is client side and server side rendering and which one is better?

	client side rendering or browser rendering happens on the clients device or the browser 
	when a user requests a webpage server sends a basic HTML Documet and javaScript code the browser then downloads and execute Java 	Script code which leads to the rendering components and finally display of the website. 

	server side rendering involves rendering the web page on the server before  transmitting it to client device when a user request a 	page the server processes the request and renders the components on the server side the server then sends back the fully rendered
	HTML to the clients browser enabling immediate display this distinction highlights an essential aspect of web development    
 
	SEO (Search engine Optimization) Search engine crawlers face difficulties indexing pages dynamically rendered on the client 
	side as a result the SEO perfomence of such pages may suffer as search engines may not fully comprehend their content and rank them 	appropriately by utilizing nextjs this  issue is resolved by sending pre-rendered code directly to the client. 

this enables:
	-> Easy crawling
	-> Indexing 
	-> LEADING TO IMPROVED SEO

directly to the client this enables easy crawling and indexing by search engines leading to the improved SEO

Why Should We Prioritize SEO?
	-> Increased organic trafic
	-> Enhanced user experience
	-> Credibility and trustworthiness
	SEO is crucial for optimizing websites visibility and ranking in search engine results by focusing on SEO you  can archive several 	benifits including organic traffic enhanced user experience credibility and trustworthines 


The Second Great Next.js features is :Routing

How do we create diffrent page routes in reacts?
	we have to install an addtional package called React Router Dom and then create routes in one of the files.
How do we create routes in Next.js?
	Next.js files-based routing system which mean the routing is handled by the file system 
	No need for external packages or complex configuation.

Another huge Next.js feture is it's flexibility to create Fullstack Appliation from Next.js Version 09 Developers behind Next.js introduced a new feature 

Its Allows us to build and deploy APIS 

-> Without managing server infrastructure
-> Worrying about scaling their server as trafic increases
With This Feature, We Can Create API Endpoints.
	

Process 

1. Create Reposotory called share_prompts and open it using visual code studio
2. Then create react application in the reposotory using below code 
        npx create-next-app@latest ./
